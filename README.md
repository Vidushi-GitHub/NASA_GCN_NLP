# Large Language Model Driven Analysis of General Coordinates Network (GCN) Circulars

The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is NASAâ€™s alert system for time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, distributing two products: real-time `Notices` and human-written `Circulars`.
We study the large language models (LLMs) application of the unstructured GCN Circulars to automatically parse and classify based on messengers and wavebands. Also, we extract the redshift information from Circulars archieve.

This work has two components:
(a) ML application for messenger classification and information extraction
(b) Delivers products including redshift table and categorized GCN types, with all code
